	abstract = {Abstract: Population-based studies of the epidemiology of myasthenia gravis (MG) have been conducted for over 50 years. Over that time, there has been a clear trend towards an increase in the reported prevalence of the disease. In recent years, there has also been an interest in determining a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of MG patients in the United States. Current estimates place the prevalence at a high value of about 20 per 100,000. The year 2000 U.S. population estimate is slightly less than 280 million. A crude estimate of the number of MG patients derived from the population estimate and the reported prevalence from selected populations indicates that there are between 53,000 and 59,900 patients in the United States at this time. The age and ethnic distributions in the United States are evolving from those that were present when the majority of the population-based studies were done, and the distribution of severity of the disease may also have changed. Future studies of the epidemiology of MG should take these factors into account, and further research into the economic and quality-of-life impact of the disease in the population is needed.},

	abstract = {Background
The objective of this study is to assess cases of thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
Methods
This case-series study analyzed VAERS reports of thrombocytopenia after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Results
Fifteen cases of thrombocytopenia were identified among 18,841,309 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 13 cases among 16,260,102 doses of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The reporting rate of thrombocytopenia was 0.80 per million doses for both vaccines. Based on an annual incidence rate of 3.3 ITP cases per 100,000 adults, the observed number of all thrombocytopenia cases, which includes ITP, following administration of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is not greater than the number of ITP cases expected.
Conclusions
The number of thrombocytopenia cases reported to VAERS does not suggest a safety concern attributable to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines at this time.},

We summarize the key evidence on some of the main current vaccine safety controversies in the United States, including (1) measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and autism; (2) thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative and the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders; (3) vaccine-induced Guillain-Barr{\~A}{\copyright} syndrome (GBS); (4) vaccine-induced autoimmune diseases; (5) safety of human papillomavirus vaccine; (6) aluminum adjuvant-induced autoimmune diseases and other disorders; and (7) too many vaccines given early in life predisposing children to health and developmental problems. A possible small increased risk of GBS following influenza vaccination has been identified, but the magnitude of the increase is less than the risk of GBS following influenza infection. Otherwise, the biological and epidemiologic evidence does not support any of the reviewed vaccine safety concerns.}},
